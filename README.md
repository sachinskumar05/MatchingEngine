<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/sachinskumar05/SachinBAMLCodeChallenge)

This is a sample coding challenge solution for BAML.

Here's why I implemented this solution:
* Being enggaged and Focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a small problem cna be extended for all 
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a project from scratch, reuse your own creativity
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, there is no perfect solution ever existed howrver, this will serve atleast as a kick starter project and future needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. Contributers are also requested for opening an issue. Thanks for the motivation
